to compile:
use the command make or compile the three files individually

to run:
Use make run
It will generate a random list for all the number of elements then call insertion sort and merge sort.
The program will write the average to an output file.

The output file outputInsertion.txt and outputMerge.txt with the averages for all the inputs.

A graph with graph showing the relationship between merge and insertion comparisons.

The graphs are called graph.xslx and document2.docx they are both the same graph but i'm not sure how to open them in linux.

The program takes about 20 minutes to completely run through all the inputs

make run1 gives a short example of how the program runs

to clean:
make clean removes the .txt files
make remove removes the rest
